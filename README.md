# Wumpus_game-Simple-Reflex-Intelligent-Agent

Creating an artificial intelligent agent to play the Wumpus Environment game
-- Environment is partially observable and non deterministic in nature
-- Simple Reflex agent is a basic implementation of conditional action rules for different percepts observed at that point of time
-- This agent does not save the previous states nor does it predict the future states
